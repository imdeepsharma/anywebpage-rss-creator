# RSS Feed Creator

This project allows you to create an RSS feed from a website that does not provide one. The script scrapes the website using Python and generates an RSS feed in XML format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Internet connection to fetch website content

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 feedgen
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone or create the script**:
   Create a file named `rss.py` and copy the following code into it:
   Code as given above

2. **Modify the script**:
   - Replace `https://example.com` with the target website's URL.
   - Update `.article-class`, `.title-class`, and `.description-class` with the appropriate CSS selectors for the content you want to scrape. Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to find these selectors.

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python rss.py
   ```

4. **Access the RSS feed**:
   - The script generates an `feed.xml` file in the same directory.
   - Open the file or use it in an RSS reader.

## Notes

- Ensure the website's terms of service permit scraping before using this script.
- Host the `feed.xml` file on a server if you want others to access it.

## Troubleshooting

- If the script doesn't generate content:
  - Check the website's structure and update the CSS selectors.
  - Verify the website URL is correct and accessible.
